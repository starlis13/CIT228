"As she reached the driver's door of the cab, 
which hung open with vines twisting in and out of its socket of a window, 
lightening flashed again, painting the whole world purple. 
In its glare Trisha saw something with slumped shoulders standing on the 
far side of the road, something with black eyes and great cocked ears like horns. 
Perhaps they were horns. It wasn't human; nor did she think it was animal. 
It was a god. It was her god, the wasp-god, standing there in the rain."
-Stephen King, Trisha In The Woods - The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon
